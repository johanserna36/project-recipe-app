# project-recipe-app

The app will allow a user to add new recipes, display a list of recipes and delete a recipe from the list by clicking a delete button.
**Features**
Introducing my new recipe app, which empowers users to create and store their own recipes with ease. This user-friendly application allows:
individuals to add the name of the recipe, upload a corresponding image, specify the type of cuisine, and include detailed instructions and ingredients. With a seamless interface, users can effortlessly manage their recipes, edit them as desired, and even remove recipes when needed. 

Whether you're a home cook or a restaurant owner, this app serves as a centralized hub for storing and sharing recipes among colleagues. 

**Tools for this project**
 React.js, CSS, HTML, and JavaScriptâ€”the app delivers a visually appealing and interactive experience for recipe creation and management.
